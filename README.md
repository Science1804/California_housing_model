# California_housing_model
Here We are working to build a tensorflow machine learning model to predict 'Median_house_value from the California_housing csv available on google . The CSV has also been uploaded in the repository. </b>
It has been made to understand the general method for creating input function , feature columns and making a train_and_evaluate function where we have used the libraries of tf.compat.v1 and finally training it while displaying the essential data.
Once again the model is not ready for deployment it is just for understanding the method of using machine learning in tensorflow 1.5
